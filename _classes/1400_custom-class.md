#### Format

Classroom-based workshop

#### Description

We teach our open-enrollment classes to diverse mixes of students from across government. Groups may attend, but the learning outcomes are oriented toward individuals.

If you are interested in using your teamâ€™s work as a vehicle for learning design as a group, we can discuss designing and delivering a custom class.

Our custom programming can simply be a class in our catalogue delivered at your organization, or it can mix existing material with newly developed content and draw from external contributors and disciplines. We would use your challenges to contextualize the learning experience, which could result in project output for your organization.

#### Learning Outcomes

Customized to suit your team's needs
