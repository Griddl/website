### Class details

#### Format

Activity-oriented learning in a classroom setting

#### Description

As the saying, “A picture is worth a thousand words” implies, visual eloquence is a major element of design. It helps explain, communicate, and clarify to others—and ourselves—what would be much harder to explain with written or spoken words. Whether you are drawing, diagramming, doodling, or rendering, your visualization can quickly explain complex problems. It can also help us to understand the depth of insights we generate to address challenges and how we present our design process to others. Come prepared to put pen to paper and marker to whiteboard, as we learn about the principles of visual eloquence for thinking and action in human-centered design.

#### Learning outcomes

* Techniques and practices to help communicate ideas effectively through sketching, drawing and diagramming;
* Exposure to combining words and visual elements in expressing complex challenges, processes, and systems;
* Experience testing ways to clarify problems visually and find solutions using signs, symbols, and hand-generated notations;
* The ability to create personal vocabularies of visual elements that enable high-level discovery, communication, and critical thinking.
