#### Format

Activity-oriented learning in a classroom setting

#### Description

Translating written or spoken information into a visual medium is a tool to help us understand it in a different way. We’ll focus on using visual language—diagrams, maps, drawings—to understand systems. We’ll first examine different types of systems, from natural to technological, and how they are represented. Then we’ll break down everyday systems into their basic parts and practice drawing their flows and behaviors. From there, you’ll create a map of your own system to use as a diagnostic tool for identifying problems, possibilities, and potential impacts. You’ll also explore levels of intervention to identify the best opportunities for change in your systems. Visualizing Systems helps you propose sustainable improvements to a system and communicate your insights to others. With practice, you’ll be seeing systems everywhere you go.

#### Learning outcomes

* Ability to visualize your challenges to help identify, communicate, and address problems;
* Exposure to applying systems thinking to complex government challenges;
* Ability to identify a system’s basic parts, flows and behaviors and organize these elements visually into maps of your own design;
* Understanding of different types of intervention and how to use it to frame decision-making.
