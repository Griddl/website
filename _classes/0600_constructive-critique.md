#### Format

Activity-oriented learning in a classroom setting

#### Description

All too often, feedback—if we have time to give it at all—is delivered impulsively, identifying weaknesses over strengths and advocating for our own view. This class will introduce
you to the principles of constructive critique. You’ll practice techniques for discussing and evaluating ideas, plans, pitches, stories, and presentations to identify future action and designs. You will also use insight gained from facilitated conversations to reflect on your personal approach to providing feedback.

#### Learning outcomes

* Exposure to the elements of constructive critique and its value giving and receiving feedback in the decision making and design process;
* Practice providing thoughtful reflection to refine whatever you are designing;
* Critical techniques to improve collaboration through constructive dialogue.
