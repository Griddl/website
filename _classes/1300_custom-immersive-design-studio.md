This multi-month series provides you with the opportunity to practice Human-centered Design (HCD) with professionals from areas such as state, local and federal government; community organizations; advocacy groups; philanthropic organizations, and academic institutions. Together, you’ll apply HCD principles while exploring a complex, real-world challenge.

We’ll focus on the societal, legislative, economic, and technological trends affecting the topic and learn how the fundamentals of HCD can help delve deeper into the root causes and generate new insights.

Note: While these studios usually begin with a partner and a custom topic, it is also possible to broaden attendance by opening enrollment.
