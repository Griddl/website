* Trained in human-centered design through The Labâ€™s Fundamentals of Human-Centered Design workshop or similar coursework;
* Currently using design as a tool for problem solving but want help during a specific part of the design process;
* In need of an external ally to help move an innovation project forward and think through strategies for overcoming potential roadblocks;
* Building an innovation practice.

If you are interested in coaching, please contact us directly and include any relevant details that might help us prepare in advance of a conversation with you.
