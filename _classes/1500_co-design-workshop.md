#### Format

Classroom-based workshop

#### Description

In human-centered design, a key method is to convene a diverse group of stakeholders with relevant knowledge and bring them into the design process. One of the most effective ways to do this is through a co-design workshop. The Lab runs co- design workshops with groups of federal employees and other important stakeholders and subject matter experts.

Our co-design workshops are designed to introduce participants to the mindsets, methods, and tools of HCD in government. We design and plan the workshops closely with our partners, and often ask participants to do pre-work to ensure theyâ€™re prepared to bring key knowledge. Our team works with agencies to capture and frame the output of each workshop and produce design documents that clarify the results and future actions to take.

#### Learning Outcomes

* Break down complex problems to understand their root causes
* Identify how human behavior might inform potential solutions
* Develop concepts for new services, programs, and strategies
* Rapidly make and test prototypes of potential solutions that address the challenge
