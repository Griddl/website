Eulani makes products and service systems alongside the people most impacted by them. She identifies and meets people’s needs in engaging ways, by drawing from a participatory process and a background in storytelling and the arts. Eulani also teaches at the Lab and has previously led courses at Made in NY Media Center, Parsons School of Design, and the Magnum Foundation. Her work has inspired doctors and patients to collaborate on improving healthcare for women Veterans; tapped the imagination of teens to reverse the food-desert status of the South Bronx; and channeled children’s gameplay to manage disease in developing countries.
