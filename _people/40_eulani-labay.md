Eulani is a service designer with the Veterans Experience team, based in New York City, whose approach to interactive storytelling draws from a background in theater and game design, along with a lifetime of writing. Eulani has taught at Made in NY Media Center and Parsons School of Design. Helping people tell their own stories is her key to social change. Eulani has tapped the imagination of teens to reverse the food-desert status of the South Bronx, channeled childrenâ€™s gameplay to manage disease in developing countries, empowered teachers to reform their urban high schools, and sparked generosity amongst a fleeting community of NYC subway riders.
