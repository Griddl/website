Sarah believes in making government service more responsive to the dynamic needs of citizens. Much of her work at the Lab involves researching how citizens engage with government service and how civil servants engage with citizens. By documenting these experiences, we can identify where the public service exchange is working and where it can be improved. Prior to joining the Lab, Sarah worked as a writer, radio journalist, ethnographic researcher, and organizer of civic engagement programs for youth. Not all at the same time. Sarah brings to her work an ethnographer’s heart, a radio journalist’s ear, and a writer’s eye for detail.
