Corinne’s visual design practice creates space for multiple viewpoints, democratizes insights, facilitates co-creation, and makes the invisible visible. She has collaborated with partners from USCIS and VA to research and design improved products, services, and experiences for both employees and “end-users.” She also uses her background in design education to co-design and lead Lab courses, and support wider capacity-building efforts. Corinne is passionate about designing accessible, inclusive, end-to-end government services, and is guided by curiosity, empathy, and optimism. She holds an MFA in Graphic Design from Yale University, and a BA in Art History and Visual Art from Fordham University.
