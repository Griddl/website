Ariel works with the Lab team to ensure that informative and transformative learning experiences take place. She also brings her love of social science research and ethnography into projects and partnerships. Things that bring Ariel joy include: participatory design in government, in-depth interviews, and the 'aha!' moments when a team is working through a tough design challenge. Prior to joining the Lab, Ariel received her MPhil in Education, Globalisation, and International Development from the University of Cambridge. She has worked on research projects focusing on practitioner/patient communications at public hospitals, behavioral nudging interventions, and curriculum design and inclusion.
