title: How we work
---

With a government-wide mission and as a revolving fund in the federal government, the Lab works with other agencies on a fee-for-service basis. We work with a wide variety of agencies that approach us, seeking to have a conversation about our work and how it might align with their current needs. Some engagements are very small and short-term, others are substantial and partnerships last for extended periods of time.

We employ a flexible approach to helping you find new avenues for solving problems. Most of our partnerships start with an initial discussion of your concerns and expectations surrounding a potential project. [Please complete the contact us form or email us for more information.](/contact/)
