<h2>USAJOBS</h2>

<h3>The partnership</h3>

<p>The USAJOBS program office has partnered with the Lab since 2015 to integrate human-centered design and user-experience design best practices into the work of improving the job seeker experience on usajobs.gov, and on other hiring and placement tools and websites. The Lab also identified many issues that negatively impact the federal hiring process. Together, the Lab and USAJOBS have worked towards solving the highest return on investment problems that fell under the purview of USAJOBS, through new and refined designs, features, and tools.</p>

<h3>The project</h3>

<p>One of many projects the Lab partnered with the USAJOBS team on was to identify problems and pain points with the application status and notifications experience for usajobs.gov applicants. In a co-design workshop, stakeholders identified problem statements and created a service blueprint visualizing the stages of the notifications process — including prioritized pain points — in order to generate design opportunities.</p>

<h3>The design</h3>

<p>The application status notifications blueprint documents and illustrates all steps of the application process involving notifications to the applicant, and includes all internal stakeholder activities, pain points, and phases of the process. </p>
