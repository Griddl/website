At the Lab we are focused on helping the federal government use design to solve complex issues. Much of our work is based in human-centered design, which is a creative and strategic approach to solving challenging problems. Our method puts people at the center of our process, taking into account their complex behaviors, mental models, and needs. This allows us to quickly generate ideas and test new prototypes that meet the true needs of our design partners.
