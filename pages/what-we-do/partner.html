title: Partner with The Lab
---

<p class="lab-content__lead">
  Are you a government agency or organization facing complex challenges? A partnership with the Lab to address your issue through the lens of human-centered design can help you to surface rich insights and consider new alternatives. Our team can help guide deep investigations of human perspectives to improve the experiences of people that engage with the government across programs, services, and experiences. Over the years, weâ€™ve worked with numerous partners across the public and private sector. 
</p>
<p>
  Design partnerships with The Lab build capacity for design at agencies in various overlapping ways:
</p>

<h4>Design Projects</h4>
<p>
  The Lab's experienced designers, with a complementary mix of skills and expertise, work with agency partners on real projects. On top of project-based services, we provide instruction, coaching, and other support as needed.
</p>

<h4>Design Capacity Building Programs</h4>
<p>
  We use our work across government to inform our educational content and approach. In some instances, we bring a cohort of partners through a customized series of educational offerings to build capacity more deeply across a team.
</p>

<h4>Design Program Development</h4>
<p>
  We connect our partners to each other and the broader design community in government to share best practices and experiences. We also advise our more mature partners as they hire designers and build design into their program.
