The Lab is a group of designers helping the federal government solve complex challenges. Across all of our services, we strive to build human-centered design capacity across the federal government. We:

*	Develop and offer design education classes informed by our experience practicing human-centered design in the federal space to help federal employees respond to and manage the complex challenges they face. To learn more about our educational offerings, visit the [Take a Class](../take-a-class/) page.  
*	Partner with federal agencies and other organizations to take on complex public sector challenges. Working with us can unleash new perspectives and fresh approaches to help solve pressing challenges. Learn more on the [Partner with the Lab](partner/) page.
<!-- Host and participate in events across the country dedicated to bringing innovators together to build and support human-centered design as an effective approach for solving complex challenges. Visit [Events](events/) to learn more about upcoming opportunities. -->
*	Create teaching tools and other resources to help others use design. [Download these materials for free under Resources](resources/).
