  According to economists, services are items that are not manufactured and are 
  typically delivered on-demand. They tend to be ongoing, or things you return 
  to again and again, unlike the single-instance events that characterize products. 
  The touchpoints of the transaction, the culture and community of the coffee shop, 
  are components of the shop&rsquo;s service, which is ongoing and intangible. Going back 
  to our coffee shop example, while the coffee you drink is a new product every day, 
  the coffee shop provides the ongoing service of stocking, making, and selling coffee.

  As readers of this Guide probably already know, the public sector is, in fact, primarily 
  a service provider. The services of governance, civil and criminal protections, environmental 
  and food safety regulations, and so many others, are the primary reasons 
  for the public sector's existence.

    <h2>Human-Centered Design Capacity Building</h2>
    <p>
      While the public sector provides many public-facing services, it also provides 
      services to itself in many forms. One of those forms is that of education 
      and capacity building for the workforce. An example of this type of service 
      is The Lab at OPM and the Veterans Experience Office&rsquo;s (VEO&rsquo;s) Human-Centered 
      Design (HCD) Capacity Building program, established in 2018.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      This program was a match between The Lab&rsquo;s mission to provide education 
      and training to all levels of government as well as private sector professionals 
      and VEO's increasing need for human-centered design capabilities.<img src="/assets/img/lab/hcd-guide/design/case-in-point-bullet-mobile.svg" width="14" height="14" title="" class="lab__case_in_point_bullet_mobile lab-hero--hcd-guide__mobile_visible" />

<p>
  In this way, the HCD Capacity Building program is an example of a service 
  that one agency (OPM) provides to another agency (VA). The exchange is comprised 
  of knowledge and practice, and return on investment is long-term and strategic. 
  Its evolution is ongoing, as there is no one-stop-shop for learning a complex 
  practice like design. In order to support the participants' development, however, 
  The Lab has articulated a path to "launch", ie, welcome into the public sector 
  design community, that includes a variety of formal, class-based requirements as 
  well as project-based evaluations.
