<h2>Using collections of references for ideation</h2>
<p>
  As design teams begin to ideate, they start to create collections of references, 
  often called Reference Decks, to help show their ideas. By accompanying these 
  collections of references with words, whether written or verbal, the team can 
  more easily understand what it collectively is thinking or what an individual 
  teammate is thinking, keep a record of that thinking, and edit the idea.

<p>
  Because design teams evolve or create new products, services, or systems, there&rsquo;s 
  no exact photo or sketch or recording of it that exists. For this reason, it&rsquo;s 
  essential to develop a collection of references that are like the product, service, 
  or system you&rsquo;re envisioning in order to express all your thoughts on how a design 
  might look, feel, and function. The purpose of using references, whether drawn, 
  photographed, recorded, et cetera, is to meet four primary goals:
</p>

<div class="lab__bullet_points_columns lab__bullet_points_column_fullwidth">
  <p>
    To explore nuances in a proposal, system, or idea.
  </p>
  <p>
    To understand those nuances.
  </p>
  <p>
    To clarify those nuances, especially if they act within a complex system.
  </p>
  <p>
    To communicate the steps above to others who may or may not be present in design meetings.
  </p>
</div>

<h2 id="when-references">When to use references</h2>
<p>
  Design team members can use references to aid in communication with their teammates 
  at any point in the design process. However, since references inform the direction 
  of an idea&rsquo;s designed form, and not the details of that form itself, they are most 
  frequently used early in the process of making a prototype design solution. If the 
  team finds itself still leaning on references as they approach a low-fidelity prototype 
  that&rsquo;s testable in the field, that can be a marker of a team that is not coalescing 
  around a design direction, and thusly the team needs to back up and start the design 
  process from the idea again.
</p>

<p>
  Specific practice on the form and cadence of using references will be provided 
  in the upcoming Design Phase Operations Guide.

    This line drawing shows two people talking. They seem to be facing each other, 
    and their little, line-drawing eyes communicate pleasure. This seems to indicate 
    that the idea of happiness in this product, service, or system has to do 
    with human connection and communication as a form or components of happiness.

  If these four images were a teammate&rsquo;s reference deck, what might be a few ideas 
  to take from it? One might be that the product, service, or system that the 
  teammate envisions has to do with happiness as a social connection, away 
  from work, in a light-hearted environment such as community engagement 
  or outdoor exercise opportunities for veterans or school children. Because this is 
  only an example, one might take away many ideas from it. For a more precise understanding 
  of the idea, the reference deck would need to be built out more fully, preferably 
  accompanied by verbal or written cues as well.

    <h2>Telehealth Toolkit</h2>
    <p>
      <a href="https://welcome-to-telehealth-kit.netlify.com/" title="The Telehealth Toolkit" target="_blank">The Telehealth Toolkit</a> is a 
      prototype knowledge-sharing repository designed for the Office of Telehealth 
      in the Veterans Health Administration. This reference deck uses examples 
      from several well-known, well-organized sites that share knowledge 
      in different ways. Multiple ideas for the Toolkit are described by the aspects 
      of each site that is highlighted.
    </p>

    <p>
      This deck is from the very beginning of the design team&rsquo;s design phase 
      for this digital product. At the beginning of the design process, the deck refers 
      to the product as the &ldquo;Genius Bar&rdquo; however, the final name is the Telehealth Toolkit. 
      This change is typical of reference decks. Because they’re begun so early 
      in the design process, they’re often called by different names from the final 
      name iteration, since the information and references that decks contain are simply 
      the starting point for the iterated design process.<img src="/assets/img/lab/hcd-guide/design/case-in-point-bullet-mobile.svg" width="14" height="14" title="" class="lab__case_in_point_bullet_mobile lab-hero--hcd-guide__mobile_visible" />
