<h2>Deliver Phase</h2>
<p>
  You&rsquo;ve drawn on your Discovery phase work and created prototypes from it. You&rsquo;ve 
  tested those prototypes with participants. You&rsquo;ve kept your leadership informed. 
  You&rsquo;ve worked with the implementation team to make sure the work will see lift-off.
</p>

<p>
  The team is set up for success. Next, with the Implementation team, move 
  into the Deliver Phase and see your work enter the world at scale!

    This four-phase diagram shows the Human-Centered Design process. The four phases shown in the circles are: 
    discovery, design, deliver, and measure. These phases are sequential with the expectation that the process as 
    a whole will be cyclical. Each part builds on and references each other, and teams can revisit previous phases 
    as they find the need or investigate different aspects of their project. The next guide in the series 
    will cover the deliver phase
