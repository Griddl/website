<p>
  The following explanations of the design principles should help you contextualize 
  why the authors of this Guide have selected these principles as items to keep 
  top-of-mind during your design phase. This section should also act as a reference 
  throughout your design process.
</p>

<p>
  The following Global Design Phase principles are a high-level, project-type-agnostic 
  means of defining Design-phase work. They allow us as designers and design teams 
  to constantly align our designs to the needs and desires of our audience and are 
  applicable across the fields for which we design in the Public Sector. The reason 
  they are listed here is that, as teams create and iterate during the Design phase, 
  they run the risk of losing touch with the urgency of the needs and values expressed 
  by participants during the Discovery phase. Having a set of guiding principles gives 
  design teams the parameters they need to constantly reference participants' needs 
  and perspectives as the design phase proceeds.

<p>
  Below, find a set of global design principles. These principles, alongside those 
  that you might create for your specific project, will help ensure that the designed 
  product, service, or solution that your team develops embodies the perspectives and 
  needs of your current and potential participants. These will be explained in detail 
  in the following sections.

<h2>Why have design phase principles</h2>
<div class="lab__base_columns lab__base_column_left">
  <h3>Global principles</h3>
  <p>
    Principles help teams maintain focus on their main objective while throughout a 
    multi-parted, challenging design process. For this reason, design teams frequently 
    create a set of guiding principles for their projects at the start of their Design Phase. 
    These principles can be derived from the Opportunity spaces identified at the end of the 
    Discovery phase. They encompass the main learnings from the participants in the Discovery phase; 
    they are not tactical rules and guidance for the team.
  </p>
</div>
<div class="lab__base_columns lab__base_column_right">
  <h3>Project-level principles</h3>
  <p>
    In addition to these global design principles, individual teams should create a set 
    of guiding principles tailored to the specific project on which they're working. 
    For example, if the design idea is to create a knowledge-sharing repository for a department, 
    a principle of the design phase could be to center the design of the repository's 
    submission structure on how the department members want to submit articles and notes, 
    not how it would be easiest to build from a technical standpoint. Guidance on how 
    to produce a set of principles for a design phase is forthcoming 
    in the Design Phase Operations Guide.
