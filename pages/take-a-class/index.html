<p class="lab-content__lead">
  At the Lab, we teach new skills through dynamic learning experiences. Our curriculum adapts to the needs of the federal government and the latest developments in public sector innovation. This allows us to produce design knowledge for government and adapt it to specific problems.
</p>
<p>
  Our classes are small and interactive. They cover both theory and practice to give participants a foundation on the given topic and awareness of how to apply aspects of class to daily challenges. Many alumni return for additional coursework and further develop skills around human-centered design.
