Our classes are attended by a diverse group of students from across the government. If you have a group that is interested in one of our classes and you are interested using your work as a vehicle for learning design, a custom class may be right for you. Custom programming can simply be a class in our catalogue delivered at your organization or it can draw from the material in our existing classes, newly developed content and external contributors and disciplines. We use your challenges to contextualize the learning experience which can result in project output for your team. If you are interested in a custom offering, contact us directly.
