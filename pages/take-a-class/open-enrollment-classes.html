<p>
  The Labâ€™s educational offerings in human-centered design provide individuals, teams, and agencies several options for growth and development. You can choose from a range of formats from a week-long total immersion Design School to shorter-form options. Classes typically occur at the Lab but we can customize them to meet the needs of your organization.
</p>

<p>
  Fulfilling our mission to bring human-centered design to government at scale, our curriculum expanded in 2018 with eight new single-day topic-specific classes. These new classes bring key aspects of design practice, process, methods and theory to broad audiences. They cover a range of topics associated with problem-solving, creative thinking, and communication.
