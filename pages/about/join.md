<p class="lab-content__lead">
  Are you looking to make a positive impact on some of the biggest challenges in government? The Lab is always looking for creative thinkers to work with us as employees or on short term engagements as detailees.

## Open positions

There are currently no open positions with the Lab. <a href="mailto:LabNetworks-subscribe-request@listserv.gsa.gov?subject=Listserv subscribe">Join our listserv</a> to hear of job openings and opportunities for design careers in government.

## Details for government employees

We offer immersive experiences in managing human-centered design projects and educational programming aligned with a focused project through details for government employees. A detail is a temporary assignment of an employee to another position within the federal government for a specified time period. The expectation is that the employee will return to their official position after their detail term ends and bring what they have learned through their work at the Lab back to their home agency.

At the Lab, we offer flexibility around the length of detail assignments. A typical detail ranges from three to six months. The Lab participates in several established programs offering details for current federal employees  â€“ including Presidential Management Fellows, Executive Potential Program and the President's Management Council Interagency Rotation Program - the as well as hosting details that we scope directly with individual federal employees. For those employees not in a position to leave their permanent role for an extended period of time, we also offer part-time and short term details (sometimes listed on the Open Opportunities website) some require only few hours or days and provide exposure to our projects and programming.

Interested in a detail? Please <a href="mailto:lab@opm.gov?subject=Detail interest">contact us at lab@opm.gov</a> to get the conversation started.

## Micro-details with the Lab through Open Opportunities

If you're a federal employee who has preferably completed at least one class with the Lab and you're interested about becoming more engaged with us, a "micro-detail" can provide you with greater exposure to our practices for a short period of time. Upcoming <a href="https://openopps.usajobs.gov">Open Opportunities</a> may offer the experience you need. Learn by doing and help us facilitate some of the trainings that we run.
