## Our Mission

Enable and engage public sector employees to transform their programs, processes, and people through human-centered design.

## Our Vision

To create the conditions that enable a dynamic public sector to deliver effective programs, services, and products.

## How We Work

Design methods can reveal new perspectives and help individuals better understand the challenges they face in their work. The Lab helps build the capacity for civil servants and Federal programs to leverage the discipline of Design to help uncover opportunities to improve programs and services that they are entrusted to deliver. Through collaboration, we build partnerships focused on creating cultural, intellectual and organizational shifts that will improve the way government works to support a more capable democracy.

## About Human-centered Design (HCD)

Human-centered design (HCD) is a creative and strategic approach to solving challenging problems. The method puts people at the center of the process. It takes into account behaviors, ways of thinking, and peoples’ needs and aspirations. HCD integrates academic disciplines including anthropology, psychology, economics, and other practical and theoretical design disciplines. It is a qualitative, participatory and iterative approach. This technique for creative problem-solving rapidly generates new ideas and innovative approaches to better understand and address people’s real needs.

As designers, we have no hidden agenda. We simply want to help our partners solve their problems and improve the way things work. Design methods help us better understand what is going on in the world. The human-centered design approach can provide a sense of why people are struggling with a specific challenge or process and offer insights about how to innovate or intervene to bring about positive change.
