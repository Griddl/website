title: Our history
---

In 2011, OPM leadership was encouraged to identify actionable ways to foster greater creativity and innovation within the federal workforce and improve the products of our work and the services we provide the United States and its people. Founded in 2013, we were first known as the OPM Innovation Lab. Renamed the Lab at OPM in 2015, we have expanded our professional and administrative staff and extended our reach across public and private sectors. Today, we collaborate with a broad network of partners, including a wide array of federal programs, as well as state and local government agencies, academic institutions, non-profits and international partners.

Over the past several years, The Labâ€™s team and portfolio of projects have grown in size and scope. More than 4,000 government employees have attended our classes and our network of alumni continues to expand.
