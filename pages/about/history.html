  Founded in 2013, we were first known as the OPM Innovation Lab. Renamed the Lab at OPM in 2015, we have expanded our professional and administrative staff and extended our reach across public and private sectors. Today, we collaborate with a broad network of partners, including a wide array of federal programs, as well as state and local government agencies, academic institutions, non-profits and international partners.
